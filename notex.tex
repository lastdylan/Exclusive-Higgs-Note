\abstracttext{ 
The exclusive Higgs could be a clean channel to study Higgs properties. The most popular 
theoretical model for the exclusive Higgs predicts a total cross section of 3 fb at LHC 
8 TeV collision energy. This note 
summarizes a search for the exclusive Higgs boson using ATLAS 8 TeV data, using the 
\hwwll\ decay channel with different flavor leptons in the final state. Selection 
criteria were developed to isolate exclusive processes from inclusive processes. Selection 
criteria that isolate Higgs-like events that were inherited from previous Higgs searches 
were also utilized. A limit of 770 fb on the total cross section of the exclusive Higgs 
production was obtained.
