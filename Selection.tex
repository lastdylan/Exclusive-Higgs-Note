\section{Event and Object Selection}
\label{sec:selection}

\par At preselection, events must pass an OR of 
\verb% EF_e24vhi_medium1%, \verb% EF_mu24i_tight%,\\
\verb% EF_e60_medium1%, \verb% EF_mu36_tight%, 
\verb% EF_e12Tvh_medium1_mu8%, 
 \verb% EF_mu18_tight_mu8_EFFS% and \verb% EF_2e12Tvh_loose1%
 to get considered for analysis. They must also have exactly two leptons 
with $\pt>15$~\GeV. A reconstructed primary vertex is not required to have 
a minimum number of tracks associated with it.  
All other preselection cuts are identical to those used for the 
\HWW\ study in Ref.~\cite{ATLASCONF2014060}. 

\par The electron identification criteria closely follows the 
 standard \HWW\ selection which relies on a likelihood-based method to
identify electrons from electromagnetic (EM) showers and Inner Detector (ID) tracks. 
A more detailed description of this method can be found in Ref. ~\cite{ATLASCONF2014060}.
EM showers and ID tracks are required to have $\pt > 15$~\GeV and lie in 
pseudorapidity less than 2.47 and out of the detector crack 
( [1.37,1.52]). Electron candidates with $15<\pt<25$~\GeV have to satisfy the very tight 
likelihood requirement and those with $\pt>25$~\GeV have to satisfy the medium 
likelihood requirement. This is because the latter are less likely to be misidentified 
objects. Calorimeter isolation is also imposed on electron 
objects by considering the energy deposited in a cone of $\Delta R = 0.3$ 
around the electron object cluster. Track isolation is also considered by taking 
the sum \pt\ of all the tracks with $\pt>400$~\MeV\ within a cone 
of size $\Delta R = 0.3$. To separate these electron objects from prompt 
electrons, impact parameter variables are used. The transverse impact parameter $d_0$
is required to satisfy $|d_0|/\sigma_{d_0}<3.0$ where $\sigma_{d_0}$ is the uncertainty on 
$d_{0}$. The longitudinal impact parameter must satisy $|z_0\sin\theta|<0.04$ mm. This improves 
the probability of selecting leptons that originate from the primary vertex. Figure~\ref{fig:electrons}
shows the \pt\ and $\eta$ distributions for electrons that pass all these requirements.

\par Candidates for muon objects should be objects with matched hits from the ID and the 
Muon Spectrometer (MS). The algorithms that match ID tracks to MS tracks are described 
in detail in Ref.~\cite{Aad2014rra}. These objects are further required to have 
$\pt > 15$~\GeV\ and must lie within pseudorapidity of 2.47. Muon selection is insensitive 
to the calorimeter crack that covers $1.37<|\eta|<1.52$. That is the reason why the only $\eta$
requirement imposed on muon candidates is for them to lie within 2.47 in $\eta$.
The sum of the pixel hits and dead sensors should be at least 1.
The sum of sct hits and dead sensors should also be at least 5.  This ensures that the 
ID track is a good candidate for matching with an MS track. Track isolation criteria is 
identical to that imposed on electron candidates. No calorimeter isolation is required 
on muons. Figure~\ref{fig:muons} shows the \pt\ and $\eta$ distribution of muon candidates 
that pass all the muon selection criteria.

\caption{\pt\ [left] and $\eta$ [right] distributions for muon candidates that pass all the 
muon selection criteria.}
\label{fig:muons}
\end{figure}

\par Electrons and muons can sometimes be very close in $\eta-\phi$ space. If an electron and 
a muon are within $\Delta R<0.1$, where $\Delta R = \sqrt{\eta^2 + \phi^2}$, the electron is removed and
the muon is kept. This is motivated by the theory that the muon would have undergone 
bremsstrahlung. If an electron track is seen in the muon spectrometer, it is removed. If two electrons are 
within $\Delta R<0.1$, the electron with higher \et\ is kept and the other one is discarded. We will 
refer to this process as {\it Electron-Muon Removal} in this note. 

\par Tracks are required to have at least 1 pixel hit and at least 4 sct hits. The minimum \pt\ 
that achieved on these tracks is 400 MeV. Availability of low-\pt\ tracks increases rejection on
QCD multijets and improves the signal survival efficiency. Reasons for this assertion will become 
clearer after the exclusivity selection criteria is discussed in detail in section~\ref{sec:exclusivity}.  
 Track candidates are also required to be within $|\eta|<2.47$. This is in line with the lepton angular 
selection criteria. Figure~\ref{fig:nTracks} shows the number of tracks that pass this criteria. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}

\par The signal region for events that pass the pre-selection criteria is carefully 
designed to select events that have Higgs-like kinematic properties. 
An exclusivity requirement is further imposed on these events to select events with additional exclusivity-like kinematic properties.
The lepton with higher \pt\ (of the two selected leptons) is required to have $\pt>25$ GeV. This will be refered to as the 'leading 
lepton'. The second lepton, with lower \pt\ is required to have $\pt>15$ GeV. It will 
be refered to as the 'sub-leading lepton'. The high \pt\ selection on the leptons  is 
meant to reduce W+jets and QCD multi-jets backgrounds, where low-\pt\ jets are 
mis-identified as leptons. To exploit the fact that the SM Higgs is neutral, the 
leading and sub-leading leptons are required to be of opposite sign. This cut will be refered to 
as 'OS Leptons' in this note. 
\par The invariant mass of the dilepton system \mll, is demanded to 
be fall within 10 GeV and 55 GeV. The reason for a lower bound is that 
some of the backgrounds such at Z+jets are not modelled correctly at low \mll. In this analysis
only Z+jets MC samples generated at $\mll>10$ GeV are used. Figure~\ref{fig:mllOSleptons}
shows the \mll\ distribution for events that pass the preselection cuts, lepton \pt\ cuts
and the opposite sign requirement on the leptons. The $\mll>10$ GeV cut yields a 
signal survival efficiency of 98\%. Figure~\ref{fig:mllOSleptons} also justifies an upper bound on 
\mll\ for Higgs events. Since the Higgs boson is of spin zero, \mll\ tends to peak at lower
 values than for the WW backgrounds. A $\mll<55$ GeV cut rejects 75\% of inclusive WW background 
and keeps 86\% of signal.

\caption{\mll\ distribution for signal (scaled by $10^4$) and relevant backgrounds for 
events that pass preselection, lepton \pt, and OS lepton cuts. Z+jets are not well modelled 
for $\mll<10$ GeV, so we consider events with $\mll>10$ GeV. Signal survival after this cut 
is 98\%. An $\mll<55$ GeV cut further rejects 75\% of WW background while keeping 86\% of signal.}
\label{fig:mllOSleptons}
\end{figure}

\par The neutrinos in the signal final state are identified by a momentum imbalance in the detector.
This imbalance is quantified by the variable 'missing transverse momentum',
\met\ that is calculated as 

\begin{equation}
\met = - \left (\sum_{selected}\pt + \sum_{soft}\pt \right )
\end{equation}   

where $\sum_{selected}\pt$ is the vectorial sum of \pt\ from 
all the objects identified by ATLAS identification 
algorithms, such as leptons, photons and jets. In this analysis these 
objects are required to have $\pt>20$ GeV. $\sum_{selected}\pt$ is the vectorial sum 
of \pt\ from all other objects that have low values of \pt, extracted 
from tracks with $\pt>0.5$ GeV that originate from the primary vertex. 
Both \met and its relative direction to leptons and jets are effective variables 
in rejecting Drell-Yan \tautau\ background, where \met\ 
aligns with a final state lepton. A special variable, \metRel (see Ref.~\cite{ATLASCONF2014060} for 
a more detailed description of this variable) is used to quantify how close in the transverse 
plane \met\ is to leptons and jets:

\begin{equation}
\metRel = \begin{cases}
				 \met\sin\Delta\phi_{near} & \text{if $\Delta\phi_{near}<\pi/2$} \\
				 \met & \text{otherwise,}
					\end{cases}
\end{equation}  

where $\Delta\phi_{near}$ is the azimuthal separation of \met\ and the nearest 
high-\pt jet or lepton. Figure~\ref{met} shows \met\ [left] and \metRel\ [right] for events that pass the 
pre-selection, electron-muon removal cuts, lepton \pt\ cuts, the 10 GeV \mll minimum requirement and the opposite sign requirement
on the leptons. For events with 0 or 1 jets, we demand $\met>20$ GeV. For events with 
2 or more jets, we demand  $\metRel>25$ GeV. These criteria are discussed in detail, with 
supporting \met\ and \metRel\ distributions, in Ref.~\cite{ATLASCONF2014060}. As a result Drell-Yan \tautau\ 
and backgrounds with a misidentified lepton are reduced.

Drell-Yan \tautau\ and those backgrounds that have a misidentified lepton.}
\label{fig:met}
\end{figure}

\par To ensure that \met\ is not mismeasured, it is important to establish some separation in $\phi$ 
between \met\ and the dilepton system. The variable \dphillmet\ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dphillmet}
quantifies this separation. We demand $\dphillmet>\pi/2$ for the signal region. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dphillmet} 
this requirement suppresses W+jets and Drell-Yan \tautau. \ptll\ is also used in this analysis to suppress
\tautau\ Drell-Yan backgrounds. The right plot in Figure~\ref{fig:dphillmet} shows that $Z/\gamma^*\to\tautau$ tends to 
have low \pt. In this analysis we demand $\ptll>30$ GeV and keep 90\% of signal.

\label{fig:dphillmet}
\end{figure}

\par The angular separation in $\phi$ between the two leptons \dfll\ which is closely related to \mll\ 
is used to reduce the WW continuum. We require that $\dfll>1.8$. This exploits the fact that the 
Higgs has spin zero. Figure~\ref{fig:dphill} shows that both WW and Drell-Yan are reduced, while maintaining 
90\% of signal.

are estimated at each cut level. {\it Blinding} refers to all the pre-selection cuts. The rest of the cuts
listed in the table are self-explanatory. Additional exclusivity cuts are imposed on Higgs-like events to 
select exclusive Higgs events. These will be discussed in Section~\ref{section:exclusivity}. Signal yields 
have been scaled by 100.
